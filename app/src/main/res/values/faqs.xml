    <!--Answers-->
    <string name="Answer1"><b>This is a Open Source Project</b>, Hence Unique in itself.</string>
    <string name="Answer2">The Application is Open Source and the best thing about a OpenSource Projects is that,
        Everyone can contribute to make it better.
        Here is my Repository <u>https://www.github.com/coder3101</u> I invite you to help me making it better for You.</string>
    <string name="Answer3">The Numbers involving \'E\' are not weird but its actually another way of representing
        bigger numbers in Scientific Notation. For Example if Your result is something like
        \"1.234568245E14\", it means 1.234568245 x 10^14.</string>
    <string name="Answer4">Those Advertisements may annoy you, but they are a Source of Earning for me. Fortuntely, You can still have the Paid Version of the Application for free, but
    since nothing is actually free so you will have to do something, you will have to compile the complete application by your ownself, Clone the Project and cook it.
    Please Do not share your cooked Applications with others, let them compile their own. Please Read the License before doing this.</string>
    <string name="Answer5">I Included all the Operations which i know (still in Class 12 didn\'t studied more than this).
    If You think that Some Operations are Missing, Please Let me Know. I will try my best to
        include them in next versions of the app. (Yeah.. I will also get the opportunity to learn new Operations)</string>
    <string name="Answer6">There are many ways to contact me, like you can reach to me on facebook here <u>https://www.facebook.com/coder3101</u></string>
    <string name="Answer7">Hey, its my birthday 31 January. Just a new way to let the World know "I was born on this date".</string>
    <string name="Answer8">The Matrix Result involving Exponents can\'t be saved as a new Variable because,
        The Highest number of digit which a Cell in the Matrix can hold is <b>999999</b>.
        It can hold upto <b>99999999</b>, if "Extra Small Font" is allowed in Settings.</string>
    <string name="Answer9">I am currently working on to bring it. But for that it needs a different
        keyboard etc, so it may take some time but sooner or later it will be added. Also i am Planning to
        add Support Trigonometric Ratios.</string>
    <string name="Answer10">I don\'t ask for Donations. I am Happy with my Work, if you really want to support me. <b>Share my work</b></string>
